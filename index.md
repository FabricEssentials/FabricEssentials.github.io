# Welcome to Fabric Essentials

Welcome to Fabric Essentials, dedicated to highlighting recommended Microsoft Fabric GitHub repositories! By the Microsoft Data Platform community, for the Microsoft Data Platform Community.

Here you will find hand-picked GitHub repositories that we recommend to make the most out of Microsoft Fabric. We select these based on various criteria, including their level of [GitHub hygiene](https://www.kevinrchant.com/2022/07/05/github-hygiene-for-microsoft-data-platform-repositories/).

Even though we recommend Git repositories created by various members of the community, we do highlight ones created by Microsoft that we think are essential. Including the Fabric Toolbox.

You can see all the recommended Microsoft Fabric related repositories created by members of the community [here](communityforks.md).
